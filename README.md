# Final- Hero Quest
My graph is going to contain about 32 total nodes the start node and exit node are the same for all classes
there will be 3 branching paths from the start node, each class will traverse through 10 nodes to the exit after the starting node.
Each path is more optimal for a specific class of hero, they will all converge on the exit node. Treasures have a 10% chance of 
spawning after the challenges in each room. Inventory holds 5 items, after picking up the 6th item the odest item will be removed
to make room for the new item except the classes weapon that they will keep with them the entire time through the dungeon. 
They will be given the option if they want to pick up the item or not, not just an automatic pick up. Challenges are mapped to the same id
as the room id to make finding and performing each challenge as easy as possible ( though finding the next closest number is simple too).
